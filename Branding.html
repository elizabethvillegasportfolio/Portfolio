            <h2>VCI Group Logo</h2>
            <p>I had the opportunity to design a refreshed logo for a framing business in Houston, Texas, seeking a brand update. The objective was to modernize the company’s visual identity while preserving its core values and strong ties to the local community. I focused on creating a logo that encapsulated the business's craftsmanship and attention to detail, ensuring it would also appeal to a wider audience. By incorporating contemporary design elements, the new logo helps the company stand out in a competitive market. The final result not only enhances the brand’s presence but also provides a fresh, professional image that better resonates with potential customers.</p>

            <h2>VCI Group LinkedIn Banner</h2>
            <p>I designed a LinkedIn banner for the framing company to highlight some of their best work while seamlessly integrating the newly refreshed logo. The banner was created with the intention of showcasing the company’s craftsmanship and attention to detail, offering a visual representation of their expertise in the framing industry. By incorporating the logo, I ensured brand consistency and strengthened the company’s visual identity across its social media presence. The design not only emphasizes the quality of their services but also presents a professional and polished image to potential clients, contributing to a stronger and more cohesive online brand presence.</p>

            <h2>Huatan Internship</h2>
            <p>For the newly acquired garden, I designed business cards to facilitate effective networking among attendees. The cards were thoughtfully crafted to align with our brand’s identity, ensuring a consistent and professional visual representation. In addition to featuring essential contact information, the design was optimized to make it easy for individuals to connect and follow up after the event. My goal was to create a lasting impression that not only reflected the garden’s values but also provided a practical tool for building meaningful business relationships. The business cards were intended to leave a professional mark and contribute to future opportunities and partnerships.</p>

            <p>For the expo, I designed a brochure that was in perfect alignment with our brand’s colors and style. The brochure was created to effectively convey our message and highlight our products, ensuring that it was both informative and visually appealing. I focused on maintaining a cohesive design that reflected our company’s identity, offering a seamless integration of branding elements throughout. The brochure served as a key tool for engaging potential clients, providing them with essential information while reinforcing our brand’s presence. It not only communicated our offerings but also acted as a visual representation of our company’s values and professionalism at the event.</p>
