            <h2>Guilt-Free Bakery</h2>
            <p>For my content and strategy work, I rebranded a new bakery called "Guilt Free Bakery." As part of the rebranding process, I developed a customer persona to better understand our target audience. I collected data by conducting interviews with individuals who had previously purchased from a vegan and gluten-free bakery located in Houston. This research provided valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors. With this data, I was able to create a detailed target audience profile, ensuring that our marketing and product offerings aligned with the needs and interests of our ideal customers, setting a solid foundation for the bakery's success.</p>

            <h2>Guilt-Free Project</h2>
            <p>I developed an XMPIE chart for my gluten-free bakery to systematically analyze and present critical data related to customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and product preferences. The chart facilitated the visualization of key insights, enabling a deeper understanding of our target audience’s behaviors and needs. By organizing this data into a clear, actionable format, we were able to identify emerging trends and make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings and marketing strategies. This analytical tool proved essential in refining our approach, ensuring that our marketing efforts were strategically aligned with customer preferences, thereby driving growth and enhancing the overall success of the bakery.</p>

            <h2>Mock Application</h2>
            <p>For e-tailing, I developed a user-friendly application aimed at helping individuals with gluten allergies find nearby gluten-free dining options. The app allows users to easily search for restaurants, cafes, and stores offering gluten-free menu items or products, providing a seamless experience for those seeking safe dining choices. Designed with accessibility in mind, the application simplifies the process of locating appropriate dining establishments, ensuring that users can make informed decisions and enjoy their meals with confidence. This solution enhances convenience for gluten-sensitive individuals, promoting a safer and more inclusive dining experience while supporting their specific dietary needs.</p>

            <h2>Room Home Planner</h2>
            <p>For my Augmented Reality project, I conducted in-depth research on an application that utilizes augmented reality (AR) to transform the real estate industry. This innovative app enables potential buyers and renters to explore properties through immersive 3D visualizations, offering virtual tours that provide a realistic experience. Additionally, users can make real-time design modifications, such as altering room layouts or decor, enhancing their ability to envision the space according to their preferences. By integrating AR technology, this app aims to streamline the property search process, providing a more interactive and engaging experience while helping clients make more informed decisions. </p>

            <p>Prior to attending the 2024 Build Expo, I conducted thorough research to identify the best products and materials to showcase our company’s offerings. This involved carefully selecting display items, promotional materials, and technology that would effectively highlight our products and services, ensuring a compelling presentation. I focused on curating an experience that would engage potential clients, demonstrating the value and quality of our solutions. By strategically choosing the right tools and displays, I aimed to create a memorable and impactful presence at the expo, maximizing brand visibility and fostering meaningful connections with prospective clients.</p>
